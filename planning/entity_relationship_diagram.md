## Create the List of Tables

Buyers Table:
The Buyers table stores information about the buyers using the platform. Each buyer is identified by a unique BuyerID and has a username, email address, and shipping address associated with their account. This table helps in managing buyer-specific data and ensuring seamless transactions.

Sellers Table:
The Sellers table contains details about the sellers on the platform. Sellers are uniquely identified by SellerID and have a username, email address, and payment information stored in this table. It facilitates the management of seller-related information, enabling secure transactions and seller verification.

Products Table:
The Products table maintains information about the products available for sale on the platform. Each product is assigned a unique ProductID and is associated with a seller through SellerID. Product details include the product title, description, price, and quantity available. This table serves as a central repository for all product-related data, ensuring accurate listings and effective inventory management.
